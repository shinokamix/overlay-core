# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is in early development. Security fixes are applied on the active default branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open public GitHub issues for security vulnerabilities.

Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting (repository `Security` tab -> `Report a vulnerability`).

If private reporting is unavailable, contact maintainers through a private channel before disclosure.

Include:

- Affected component/file
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Impact assessment
- Suggested remediation (if available)

You should receive an acknowledgment within 72 hours.

## Disclosure Policy

- We validate and triage reports before public disclosure.
- We coordinate release timing for fixes.
- We credit responsible disclosure unless anonymity is requested.

## Scope Notes

Given the product focus (desktop capture + AI providers), high-priority areas are:

- Local data handling and storage
- Provider key handling
- Capture/recording permission boundaries
- Dependency supply chain risks
